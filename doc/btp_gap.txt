Commands and responses:

        Opcode 0x00 - Error response

        Opcode 0x01 - Read Supported Commands command/response

                Controller Index:       <non-controller>
                Command parameters:     <none>
                Response parameters:    <supported commands> (variable)

                Each bit in response is a flag indicating if command with
                opcode matching bit number is supported. Bit set to 1 means
                that command is supported. Bit 0 is reserved and shall always
                be set to 0. If specific bit is not present in response (less
                than required bytes received) it shall be assumed that command
                is not supported.

                In case of an error, the error response will be returned.

        Opcode 0x02 - Read Controller Index List command/response

                (and scan responses) from broadcasters (that are not visible
                during General or Limited discovery, because those are not
                discoverable). This procedure can use either passive or active

                "Use limited discovery procedure" (bit 2) is excluded.
                If "Use filter accept list" (bit 6) is set, then the filter
                accept list will be used to filter discovered devices.

                The BIS data path should be setup when the BIG sync is established or BIG has
                been created. And the BIS data path setup event indicates the successful
                configuration of data transmission path for a specific Broadcast Isochronous

                This event can be sent after IUT received the periodic BIGInfo Advertising Report
                on established sync.

                The unit of the ISO_Interval parameter is 1.25ms. Such as 0x10 represents 20ms.
                The unit of the SDU_Interval parameter is ms.

                Possible values for the PHY parameter are a bit-field or of the following bits:
                        1 = PHY 1M
                        2 = PHY 2M
                        3 = PHY Coded

                Possible values for the Framing parameter are:
                        0 = Unframed PDUs
                        1 = Framed PDUs, Segmentable mode
                        2 = Framed PDUs, Unsegmented mode

                Available Encryption:
                        0 - The BIS is unencrypted.
                        1 - The BIS is encrypted.
