BAP Service (ID 14)
====================

Commands and responses:

	Opcode 0x00 - Error response

	Opcode 0x01 - Read supported commands
		Controller Index:    <controller id>
		Command parameters:  <none>
		Response parameters: <supported commands> (variable)

		Each bit in response is a flag indicating if command with
		opcode matching bit number is supported. Bit set to 1 means
		that command is supported. Bit 0 is reserved and shall always
		be set to 0. If specific bit is not present in response (less
		than required bytes received) it shall be assumed that command
		is not supported.

		In case of an error, the error response will be returned.

	Opcode 0x02 - Discover and Subscribe
		Controller Index:    <controller id>
		Command parameters:	Address_Type (1 octet)
					Address  (6 octets)
		Response parameters: <none>

        This command is used to discover all remote PACS and ASCS
        characteristics. In case of an error, the error status response
        will be returned. In case of a success, the IUT continues processing
        the command asynchronously. During discovery, the IUT may send events:
                    Discover and Subscribe Completed event
                    Codec Capabilities Found event
                    ASE Found event

	Opcode 0x03 - Send
		Controller Index:    <controller id>
		Command parameters:	Address_Type (1 octet)
					Address  (6 octets)
					ASE ID (1 octet)
					Data len (1 octet)
					Data (varies)
		Response parameters:	Number of buffered bytes of data (1 octet)

        This command is used to send a data packet stream to the given ASE.
        In case of an error, the error status response will be returned.
        In case of a success, the IUT continues processing the command
        asynchronously.

Events:
	Opcode 0x80 - Discover and Subscribe Completed event

		Controller Index:	<controller id>
		Event parameters:	Address_Type (1 octet)
					Address (6 octets)
					Status  (1 octet)

        This event indicates that the IUT finished discovery of PACS and ASCS
        characteristics and subscribing to their notifications.

	Opcode 0x81 - Codec Capabilities Found event

		Controller Index:	<controller id>
		Event parameters:	Address_Type (1 octet)
					Address (6 octets)
					PAC dir (1 octet)
					Coding Format (1 octet)
					Frequencies (2 octets)
					Frame Durations (1 octet)
					Octets Per Frame (4 octets)
					Supported Audio Channel Counts (1 octet)

        About parameters:
            Frequencies: a bitfield as defined in Assigned Numbers,
            6.12.4.1 Supported_Sampling_Frequencies.

            Frame durations: as defined in Assigned Numbers, 6.12.4.2
            Supported_Frame_Durations.

            Octets Per Frame: as defined in Assigned Numbers 6.12.4.4
            Supported_Octets_Per_Codec_Frame.

		This event returns the found PACS capabilities record info.

	Opcode 0x82 - ASE Found event

		Controller Index:	<controller id>
		Event parameters:	Address_Type (1 octet)
					Address (6 octets)
					ASE ID (1 octet)

        This event returns the found ASE info.

	Opcode 0x83 - Stream Received event

		Controller Index:	<controller id>
		Event parameters:	Address_Type (1 octet)
					Address (6 octets)
					ASE ID (1 octet)
					Data len (1 octet)
					Data (varies)

        This event returns the received data stream packet.
