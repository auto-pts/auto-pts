Microphone Control Service(ID 18)
=================================

Commands and responses:

        Opcode 0x00 - Error response

        Opcode 0x01 - Read supported commands

                Controller Index:       <controller id>
                Command parameters:     <none>
                Response parameters:    <supported commands> (variable)

                Each bit in response is a flag indicating if command with
                opcode matching bit number is supported. Bit set to 1 means
                that command is supported. Bit 0 is reserved and shall always
                be set to 0. If specific bit is not present in response (less
                than required bytes received) it shall be assumed that command
                is not supported.

                In case of an error, the error response will be returned.

                Response parameters:    <none>

                This command is used to request Mute operation. During
                operation, the IUT may send event:
                        Mute State event

                In case of an error, the error reponse will be returned.

        Opcode 0x05 - Unmute

                Controller Index:       <controller id>
                Command parameters:     <none>
                Response parameters:    <none>

                This command is used to request Unmute operation. During
                operation, the IUT may send event:
                        Mute State event

                In case of an error, the error reponse will be returned.

                                        Address (6 octets)
                                        Mute state (1 octet)
