		Controller Index:	<controller id>
		Command parameters:	<none>
		Response parameters:	<supported commands> (variable)

		Each bit in response is a flag indicating if command with
		opcode matching bit number is supported. Bit set to 1 means
		that command is supported. Bit 0 is reserved and shall always
		be set to 0. If specific bit is not present in response (less
		than required bytes received) it shall be assumed that command
		is not supported.

		In case of an error, the error response will be returned.
