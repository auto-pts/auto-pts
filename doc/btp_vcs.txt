Volume Control Service (ID 8)
=============================

Commands and responses:

        Opcode 0x00 - Error response

        Opcode 0x01 - Read Supported Commands command/response

                Controller Index:       <non-controller>
                Command parameters:     <none>
                Response parameters:    <supported commands> (variable)

                Each bit in response is a flag indicating if command with
                opcode matching bit number is supported. Bit set to 1 means
                that command is supported. Bit 0 is reserved and shall always
                be set to 0. If specific bit is not present in response (less
                than required bytes received) it shall be assumed that command
                is not supported.

                In case of an error, the error response will be returned.

        Opcode 0x02 - Set volume command
                Controller Index:       <controller id>
                Command parameters:     Volume (1 octet)
                Response parameters:    <none>
                
                This command is used to set absolute volume.

                In case of an error, the error response will be returned.

        Opcode 0x03 - Volume up
                Controller Index:       <controller id>
                Command parameter:      <none>
                Response parameters:    <none>

                This command is used for increasing the volume setting in VCS.

                In case of an error, the error reponse will be returned.

        Opcode 0x04 - Volume down
                Controller Index:       <controller id>
                Command parameter:      <none>
                Response parameters:    <none>

                This command is used for decreasing the volume setting in VCS.

                In case of an error, the error response will be returned.

        Opcode 0x05 - Mute
                Controller Index:       <controller id>
                Command parameter:      <none>
                Response parameters:    <none>

                This command is used for setting mute value to "mute" in VCS.

                In case of an error, the error response will be returned.

        Opcode 0x06 - Unmute
                Controller Index:       <controller id>
                Command parameter:      <none>
                Response parameters:    <none>

                This command is used for setting mute value to "unmute" in VCS.

                In case of an error, the error response will be returned.

        Opcode 0x07 - Register Volume Control Service
                Controller Index:       <controller id>
                Command parameters:     Step (1 octet)
                                        Flags (1 octet)
                                        Volume (1 octet)
                Response parameters:    <none>

                This command is used to set initial VCS settings, register and
                start the service.
