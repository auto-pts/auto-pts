TMAP Service (ID 28)
=====================

Commands and responses:

        Opcode 0x00 - Error response

        Opcode 0x01 - Read Supported Commands command/response

                Controller Index:       <non-controller>
                Command parameters:     <none>
                Response parameters:    <supported commands> (variable)

                Each bit in response is a flag indicating if command with
                opcode matching bit number is supported. Bit set to 1 means
                that command is supported. Bit 0 is reserved and shall always
                be set to 0. If specific bit is not present in response (less
                than required bytes received) it shall be assumed that command
                is not supported.

                In case of an error, the error response will be returned.


        Opcode 0x02 - Discover and Subscribe

                Controller Index:       <controller id>
                Command parameters:     Address_Type (1 octet)
                                        Address (6 octets)
                Response parameters:    <none>

                This command is used to discover all remote TMAP characteristics.
                In case of an error, the error status response will be returned.
                In case of a success, the IUT continues processing the command
                asynchronously.

Events:
        Opcode 0x80 - Discover and Subscribe Completed event

                Controller Index:       <controller id>
                Event parameters:       Address_Type (1 octet)
                                        Address (6 octets)
                                        Status  (1 octet)
                                        Role    (2 octet)

                This event indicates that the IUT finished discovery TMAP
                characteristics.
