RFCOMM Service (ID 0x20)
=====================

Commands and responses:

        Opcode 0x00 - Error response

        Opcode 0x01 - Read Supported Commands command/response

                Controller Index:       <controller id>
                Command parameters:     <none>
                Response parameters:    <supported commands> (variable)

                Each bit in response is a flag indicating if command with
                opcode matching bit number is supported. Bit set to 1 means
                that command is supported. Bit 0 is reserved and shall always
                be set to 0. If specific bit is not present in response (less
                than required bytes received) it shall be assumed that command
                is not supported.

                In case of an error, the error response will be returned.

                                        Channel (1 octet)
                                        Flags (1 octet)
                                        Data (variable)
                Response parameters:    <none>

                This command is used to send data over an established RFCOMM connection.
                The data is provided as a bytearray, followed by its length and the channel.

                Flags are reserved for future use.

                In case of an error, the error response will be returned.

                This command is used to initiate a disconnection of an established 
                RFCOMM connection on the specified channel.

                Flags are reserved for future use.

                In case of an error, the error response will be returned.

Events:
        Opcode 0x80 - Connected event

                Controller Index:       <controller id>
                Event parameters:       Channel (1 octet)
                                        State (1 octet)

                This event indicates that an RFCOMM connection has been terminated.
                It provides the channel number and the current state of the RFCOMM connection.

        Opcode 0x82 - Data Received event

                Controller Index:       <controller id>
                Event parameters:       Channel (1 octet)
