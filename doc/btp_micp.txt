Microphone Control Profile(ID 16)
=================================

Commands and responses:

        Opcode 0x00 - Error response

        Opcode 0x01 - Read Supported Commands command/response

                Controller Index:       <non-controller>
                Command parameters:     <none>
                Response parameters:    <supported commands> (variable)

                Each bit in response is a flag indicating if command with
                opcode matching bit number is supported. Bit set to 1 means
                that command is supported. Bit 0 is reserved and shall always
                be set to 0. If specific bit is not present in response (less
                than required bytes received) it shall be assumed that command
                is not supported.

                In case of an error, the error response will be returned.

        Opcode 0x02 - Discovery

                Controller Index:       <controller id>
                Command parameters:     Address_Type (1 octet)
                                        Address (6 octets)
                Response parameters: <none>

                This command is used to discover primary service, AICS included
                service(s) and all characteristics related to them. During discovery,
                the IUT may send events:
                                Discovered Event

                In case of an error, the error response will be returned.

        Opcode 0x03 - Mute read

                Controller Index:       <controller id>
                Command parameters:     Address_Type (1 octet)
                                        Address (6 octets)
                Response parameters:    <none>

                This command is used to read Mute characteristic. During read
                operation, the IUT may send event:
                                Mute State event

                In case of an error, the error reponse will be returned.

        Opcode 0x04 - Mute

                Controller Index:       <controller id>
                Command parameters:     Address_Type (1 octet)
                                        Address (6 octets)
                Response parameters:    <none>

                This command is used to request Mute operation. During write operation,
                the IUT may send event:
                                Mute State event

                In case of an error, the error reponse will be returned.


Events:
        Opcode 0x80 - Discovered Event

                Controller Index:       <controller id>
                Event parameters:       Address_Type (1 octet)
                                        Address (6 octets)
                                        ATT status (1 octet)
                                        MICP Mute handle (2 octets)
                                        AICS State handle (2 octets)
                                        AICS Gain handle (2 octets)
                                        AICS Type handle (2 octets)
                                        AICS Status handle (2 octets)
                                        AICS Control Point handle (2 octets)
                                        AICS Description handle (2 octets)

                This event returns handles of MICP characteristic and AICS included
                service characteristics.

        Opcode 0x81 - Mute State event

                Controller Index:       <controller id>
                Event parameters:       Address_Type (1 octet)
                                        Address (6 octets)
                                        ATT status (1 octet)
                                        Mute state (1 octet)

                This event returns Mute state (from primary service).
