GATT Service (ID 2, DEPRECATED)
===================

Commands and responses:

        Opcode 0x00 - Error response

        Opcode 0x01 - Read Supported Commands command/response

                Controller Index:       <non-controller>
                Command parameters:     <none>
                Response parameters:    <supported commands> (variable)

                Each bit in response is a flag indicating if command with
                opcode matching bit number is supported. Bit set to 1 means
                that command is supported. Bit 0 is reserved and shall always
                be set to 0. If specific bit is not present in response (less
                than required bytes received) it shall be assumed that command
                is not supported.

                In case of an error, the error response will be returned.

                Service ID of service declaration is returned in the response.
                Attribute database shall be initiated sequentially.
                After this issuing this command tester shall add characteristics

                                        0x10 = UUID128

                This procedure is used to query GATT Server for attributes based
                on given search pattern. Attributes can be searched using
                Attribute Handle range and Attribute Type.

                In case of an error, the error response will be returned.

        Opcode 0x1d - Get Attribute Value

                                        Value (variable)

                This procedure is used to query GATT Server for attribute value.
                In case of long attribute value, multiple responses will be
                sent. BTP_STATUS_SUCCESS response indicates the procedure is
                finished.

                In case of an error, the error response will be returned.

                                        0x02 = Any

                This procedure is used to change GATT database. If handles
                provided are zero it is up to IUT to select range that will be
                changed. If operation is "Any" IUT may add or remove items
                from database.

                In case of an error, the error response will be returned.

                This procedure is used to read multiple variable length
                Characteristic Values from a server.
                Read results are returned in the response to this command in
                form of {Length, Value} tuples. The Total_Data_Length is total
                length of response data (sum of lengths of all tuples}.
                ATT_Response shall be set to 0x00, if Read has been completed
                successfully. Otherwise it shall be set to ATT error code
                received.

                In case of an error, the error response will be returned.
