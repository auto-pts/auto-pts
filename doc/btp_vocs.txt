Volume Offset Control Service (ID 11)
=============================

Commands and responses:

        Opcode 0x00 - Error response

        Opcode 0x01 - Read Supported Commands command/response

                Controller Index:       <non-controller>
                Command parameters:     <none>
                Response parameters:    <supported commands> (variable)

                Each bit in response is a flag indicating if command with
                opcode matching bit number is supported. Bit set to 1 means
                that command is supported. Bit 0 is reserved and shall always
                be set to 0. If specific bit is not present in response (less
                than required bytes received) it shall be assumed that command
                is not supported.

                In case of an error, the error response will be returned.

                This command is used for reading VOCS Offset State characteristic.
                During operation, the IUT may send event:
                                VOCS Offset State Event

                In case of an error, the error response will be returned.

                Command parameters:     Address_Type (1 octet)
                                        Address (6 octets)
                Response parameters:    <none>

                This command is used for reading VOCS Location characteristic.
                During operation, the IUT may send event:
                                VOCS Audio Location Event

                In case of an error, the error response will be returned.

        Opcode 0x06 - Offset State Set

                Controller Index:       <controller id>
                Command parameters:     Address_Type (1 octet)

                Response parameters:    <none>

                This command is used for setting VOCS Offset state. During
                operation, the IUT may send event:
                                VOCS Offset State Event
                                VOCS Procedure Event

Events:
        Opcode 0x80 - VOCS Offset State event
