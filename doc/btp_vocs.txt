Volume Offset Control Service (ID 11)
=============================

Commands and responses:

	Opcode 0x00 - Error response

	Opcode 0x01 - Read supported commands
		Controller Index:	<controller id>
		Command parameters:	<none>
		Response parameters:	<supported commands> (variable)

		Each bit in response is a flag indicating if command with
		opcode matching bit number is supported. Bit set to 1 means
		that command is supported. Bit 0 is reserved and shall always
		be set to 0. If specific bit is not present in response (less
		than required bytes received) it shall be assumed that command
		is not supported.

		In case of an error, the error response will be returned.

	Opcode 0x02 - Update audio location

		Controller Index:	<controller id>
		Command parameters:	Location (4 octets)
		Response parameters:	<none>

		This command is used to change audio location.

		In case of an error, the error response will be returned.

	Opcode 0x03 - Update audio description

		Controller Index:	<controller id>
		Command parameters:	Description (string)
		Response parameters:	<none>

		This command is used to change audio description.

		In case of an error, the error response will be returned.

	Opcode 0x04 - Offset State Get

		Controller Index:	<controller id>
		Command parameters:     Address_Type (1 octet)
					Address (6 octets)
		Response parameters:	<none>

		This command is used for reading VOCS Offset State characteristic.
		During operation, the IUT may send event:
				VOCS Offset State Event

		In case of an error, the error response will be returned.

	Opcode 0x05 - Location Get

		Controller Index:	<controller id>
		Command parameters:     Address_Type (1 octet)
					Address (6 octets)
		Response parameters:	<none>

		This command is used for reading VOCS Location characteristic.
		During operation, the IUT may send event:
				VOCS Audio Location Event

					Offset (2 octets)

		This event returns VOCS Offset State information.

	Opcode 0x81 - VOCS Audio Location event

		Controller Index:	<controller id>
		Event parameters:	Address_Type (1 octet)
					Address (6 octets)
					ATT status (1 octet)
					Location (4 octets)

		This event returns VOCS Audio Location information.
