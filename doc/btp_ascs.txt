Audio Stream Control Service (ID tbd)
=====================================

Opcodes 0x02 and higher are use in server and client roles and require a Chan_ID.
In Client role, ASCS Client Connect to peer is used to setup the GATT connection and return the Chan_ID. 
In Server role, the lower test will query the ASCS Service and register for notifications. This is
reported in the ASCS Server Peer Connected event to provide the Chan_ID to BTP.


Commands and responses:

	Opcode 0x00 - Error response

	Opcode 0x01 - Read Supported Commands command/response

		Controller Index:	<controller id>
		Command parameters:	<none>
		Response parameters:	<supported commands> (variable)

		Each bit in response is a flag indicating if command with
		opcode matching bit number is supported. Bit set to 1 means
		that command is supported. Bit 0 is reserved and shall always
		be set to 0. If specific bit is not present in response (less
		than required bytes received) it shall be assumed that command
		is not supported.

		In case of an error, the error response will be returned.

	Opcode 0x02 - ASCS Client Connect to peer

		Controller Index:	<controller id>
		Command parameters:	Address_Type (1 octet)
					Address (6 octets)
		Response parameters:	Chan_ID (1 octet)
					ASE_Count (1 octet)
					ASE List (variable)

		ASE:			ASE_ID (1 octet)
					ASE_Type (1 octet)

		Valid ASE_Type parameter values:
					0x00 = Sink
					0x01 = Source

		In case of an error, the error response will be returned.

	Opcode 0x03: ASCS Configure Codec

		Controller Index:	<controller id>
		Command parameters:	Chan_ID (1 octet)
					ASE_ID (1 octet)
					Coding_Format (1 octet)
					Frequency_hz  (4 octets)
					Frame_Duration_us (2 octets)
					Audio Locations (4 octets)
					Octets_Per_Frame (2 octets)
		Response parameters:	Presentation_Delay_Min_us (3 octets)
					Presentation_Delay_Max_us (3 octets)

		Coding_Format: LC3 = 0x06, Vendor Specific = 0xff

		In case of an error, the error response will be returned.

	Opcode 0x04: ASCS Configure QoS

		Controller Index:	<controller id>
		Command parameters:	Chan_ID (1 octet)

					CIG_ID (1 octet)
					CIS_ID (1 octet)
					Sdu_Interval (2 octet)
					Framing (1 octet)
					Max_Sdu_Size (2 octets)
					Retransmission_Number (1 octets)
					Max_Transport_Latency (1 octets)
		Response parameters:	<None>

		In case of an error, the error response will be returned.

	Opcode 0x05: ASCS Enable

		Controller Index:	<controller id>
		Command parameters:	Chan_ID (1 octet)
					ASE_ID (1 octet)
		Response parameters:	<None>

		In case of an error, the error response will be returned.

	Opcode 0x06: ASCS Receiver Start Ready

		Controller Index:	<controller id>
		Command parameters:	Chan_ID (1 octet)
					ASE_ID (1 octet)
		Response parameters:	<None>

		In case of an error, the error response will be returned.

	Opcode 0x07: ASCS Receiver Stop Ready

		Controller Index:	<controller id>
		Command parameters:	Chan_ID (1 octet)
					ASE_ID (1 octet)
		Response parameters:	<None>

		In case of an error, the error response will be returned.

	Opcode 0x08: ASCS Disable

		Controller Index:	<controller id>
		Command parameters:	Chan_ID (1 octet)
					ASE_ID (1 octet)
		Response parameters:	<None>

		In case of an error, the error response will be returned.

	Opcode 0x09: ASCS Release

		Controller Index:	<controller id>
		Command parameters:	Chan_ID (1 octet)
					ASE_ID (1 octet)
		Response parameters:	<None>

		In case of an error, the error response will be returned.

	Opcode 0x0A: ASCS Update Metadata

		Controller Index:	<controller id>
		Command parameters:	Chan_ID (1 octet)
					ASE_ID (1 octet)
		Response parameters:	<None>

		In case of an error, the error response will be returned.


Events:

	Opcode 0x80 - ASCS Server Peer Connected

		Controller Index:	<controller id>
		Event parameters:	Chan_ID (1 octet)

		This event indicates that a lower tester has subscribed to 
		one or more characteristics. The Chan_ID is needed to for
		Opcodes 0x03 and higher in Server role.
