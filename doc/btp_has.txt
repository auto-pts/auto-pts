HAS Service (ID 15)
===================

Commands and responses:

        Opcode 0x00 - Error response

        Opcode 0x01 - Read Supported Commands command/response

                Controller Index:       <non-controller>
                Command parameters:     <none>
                Response parameters:    <supported commands> (variable)

                Each bit in response is a flag indicating if command with
                opcode matching bit number is supported. Bit set to 1 means
                that command is supported. Bit 0 is reserved and shall always
                be set to 0. If specific bit is not present in response (less
                than required bytes received) it shall be assumed that command
                is not supported.

                In case of an error, the error response will be returned.

        Opcode 0x02: HAS Set Active Preset Index

                Controller Index:       <controller id>
                Command parameters:     Address_Type (1 octet)
                                        Address (6 octets)
                                        Preset Index (1 octet)
                Response parameters:    <None>

                This command is used to set the Active Preset. 
                If called with a Preset Index of 0, it will de-select the Active Preset.
                
                In case of an error, the error response will be returned.

        Opcode 0x03: HAS Set Preset Name

                Controller Index:       <controller id>
                Command parameters:     Address_Type (1 octet)
                                        Address (6 octets)
                                        Preset Index (1 octet)
                                        Name Length (1 octet)
                                        Name (<Name Length> octets)
                Response parameters:    <None>

                Name Length holds the number of bytes in the UTF-8 encoded name. 

                This command is used to change the Name of a Preset.

                In case of an error, the error response will be returned.

        Opcode 0x04: HAS Remove Preset

                Controller Index:       <controller id>
                Command parameters:     Address_Type (1 octet)
                                        Address (6 octets)
                                        Preset Index (1 octet)
                Response parameters:    <None>

                Passing Preset Index := 0 will remove all active Presets.

                This command is used to delete a specific Preset or all Presets.

                In case of an error, the error response will be returned.

        Opcode 0x05: HAS Add Preset

                Controller Index:       <controller id>
                Command parameters:     Address_Type (1 octet)
                                        Address (6 octets)
                                        Preset Index (1 octet)
                                        Preset Properties (1 octet)
                                        Name Length (1 octet)
                                        Name (<Name Length> octets)
                Response parameters:    <None>

                Preset Properties is a bit-field, with the following interpretation: 
                Preset Properties:
                                1 - Preset will be Writable (N.U.)
                                2 - Preset will be Available

        Name shall be a UTF-8 encoded string (nul-termination not needed). 
                Name Length holds the number of bytes in the UTF-8 encoded name. 

                This command is used to add a new Preset.

                In case of an error, the error response will be returned.

        Opcode 0x06: HAS Set Preset Properties (available/unavailable)

                Controller Index:       <controller id>
                Command parameters:     Address_Type (1 octet)
                                        Address (6 octets)
                                        Preset Index (1 octet)
                                        Preset Properties (1 octet)
                Response parameters:    <None>

                Preset Properties is a bit-field, with the following interpretation: 
                Preset Properties:
                                1 - Preset will be Writable (N.U.)
                                2 - Preset will be Available

                This command is used to change a Preset's available/unavailable property.

                In case of an error, the error response will be returned.
