		Controller Index:	<controller id>
		Command parameters:	Address_Type (1 octet)
					Address (6 octets)
		Response parameters:	<none>

		This command is used to discover all remote CSIP characteristics.
		In case of an error, the error status response will be returned.
		In case of a success, the IUT continues processing the command
		asynchronously.
		During operation, the IUT may send events:
				CSIP Lock event
				CSIP Sirk event

	Opcode 0x03 - Start Ordered Access
		Controller Index:	<controller id>
		Command parameters:	Flags (1 octet)
		Response parameters:	<none>

		This command is used to start the CSIP Ordered Access procedure.

				CSIP Lock event

	Opcode 0x05 - Set Coordinator Lock Release

		Controller Index:	<controller id>
		Command parameters:     Members count (1 octet)
		Response parameters:    <none>

		During operation, the IUT may send event:
				CSIP Lock event

Events:
	Opcode 0x80 - Discover Completed event

		Controller Index:	<controller id>
		Event parameters:	Address Type (1 octet)
					Address (6 octets)
					ATT status (1 octet)
					Set Sirk Handle (1 octet)
					Set Size Handle (1 octet)
					Set Lock Handle (1 octet)
					Rank Handle (1 octet)

		This event returns handles of CSIP characteristsics.

	Opcode 0x81 - Sirk event

		Controller Index:       <controller id>
		Event parameters:       Address Type (1 octet)
					Address (6 octets)
					SIRK (16 octets)

		This event returns SIRK (Set identity resolving key) value.

	Opcode 0x82 - Lock event

		Controller Index:       <controller id>
		Event parameters:       Lock (1 octet)
