Core Service (ID 0)
===================

Commands and responses:

        Opcode 0x00 - Error response

        Opcode 0x01 - Read Supported Commands command/response

                Controller Index:       <non-controller>
                Command parameters:     <none>
                Response parameters:    <supported commands> (variable)

                Each bit in response is a flag indicating if command with
                opcode matching bit number is supported. Bit set to 1 means
                that command is supported. Bit 0 is reserved and shall always
                be set to 0. If specific bit is not present in response (less
                than required bytes received) it shall be assumed that command
                is not supported.

                In case of an error, the error response will be returned.

        Opcode 0x02 - Read Supported Services command/response

                Controller Index:       <non-controller>
                Command parameters:     <none>
                Response parameters:    <supported services> (variable)

                Each bit in response is a flag indicating if service with ID
                matching bit number is supported. Bit set to 1 means that
                service is supported. If specific bit is not present in response
                (less than required bytes received) it shall be assumed that
                service is not supported.

                In case of an error, the error response will be returned.

        Opcode 0x03 - Register Service command/response

                Controller Index:       <non-controller>
                Command parameters:     Service ID (1 octet)
                Response parameters:    <none>

                In case a command is sent for an undeclared service ID, it will
                be rejected. Also there will be no events for undeclared
                service ID.

                In case of an error, the error response will be returned.

        Opcode 0x04 - Unregister Service command/response

                Controller Index:       <non-controller>
                Command parameters:     Service ID (1 octet)
                Response parameters:    <none>

                In case of an error, the error response will be returned.

        Opcode 0x05 - Log message at IUT

                Controller Index:       <non-controller>
                Command parameters:     Log_Message_Length (2 Octets)
                                        Log_Message (variable)
                Response parameters:    <none>

                In case of an error, the error response will be returned.

        Opcode 0x06 - Read BTP MTU

                Controller Index:       <non-controller>
                Command parameters:     <none>
                Response parameters:    BTP_MTU (2 octets)

                This allows to read BTP protocol MTU on OUT device. MTU is maximum
                number of bytes that IUT can receive or send (including BTP header).

                In case of an error, the error response will be returned.

Events:
        Opcode 0x80 - IUT ready event

                Controller Index:       <non-controller>
                Event parameters:       <none>

                This event indicates that IUT has been initialized and is ready to
                receive BTP commands.
                Tester shall wait for this event before sending any command to the IUT.
