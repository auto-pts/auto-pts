L2CAP Service (ID 3)
==================

Commands and responses:

	Opcode 0x00 - Error response

	Opcode 0x01 - Read Supported Commands command/response

		Controller Index:	<controller id>
		Command parameters:	<none>
		Response parameters:	<supported commands> (variable)

		Each bit in response is a flag indicating if command with
		opcode matching bit number is supported. Bit set to 1 means
		that command is supported. Bit 0 is reserved and shall always
		be set to 0. If specific bit is not present in response (less
		than required bytes received) it shall be assumed that command
		is not supported.

		In case of an error, the error response will be returned.

	Opcode 0x02 - Connect command/response

		Controller Index:	<controller id>
		Command parameters:	Address_Type (1 octet)
					Address (6 octets)

					MTU (2 octets)
					Num (1 octet)
					Options (1 octet)
		Response parameters:	Num (1 octet)
					Chan_IDs (1 octet x num of channels created)

		This command is used to create an L2CAP channel.
		Chan_ID is returned in the response to this command to allow

		shall be expected after issuing this command.

		if Num > 1 then Enhanced Credit Based L2CAP channels shall be created.
		Return value will contain a list of Chan_IDs that were created by
		this command.

		Available options:
		bit 0 - ECFC - If set then Enhanced Credit Based L2CAP channel
			shall be created even if Num == 1. This is used to
