		Controller Index:	<controller id>
		Command parameters:	<none>
		Response parameters:	<supported commands> (variable)

		Each bit in response is a flag indicating if command with
		opcode matching bit number is supported. Bit set to 1 means
		that command is supported. Bit 0 is reserved and shall always
		be set to 0. If specific bit is not present in response (less
		than required bytes received) it shall be assumed that command
		is not supported.
