Audio Input Control Service (ID 10)
==================================

Commands and responses:

        Opcode 0x00 - Error response

        Opcode 0x01 - Read Supported Commands command/response

                Controller Index:       <non-controller>

                Response parameters:    <supported commands> (variable)

                Each bit in response is a flag indicating if command with
                opcode matching bit number is supported. Bit set to 1 means
                that command is supported. Bit 0 is reserved and shall always
                be set to 0. If specific bit is not present in response (less
                than required bytes received) it shall be assumed that command
                is not supported.

                In case of an error, the error response will be returned.
