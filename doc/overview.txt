Overview
========

This document describes the format of data used for communicating between tester
and implementation under test (IUT).

The protocol is SOCK_STREAM based and follows a strict PDU specification
with a generic header and initial registration exchange. The communication is
driven from tester with commands/response exchange. The protocol is single PDU
exchanged based, meaning every command requires a response. IUT will use events
to signal notifications.

Commands and events use single socket. All services are multi-plexed over same
socket.

Packet Structures
=================

Every packet will follow the basic header to support simple multi-plexing
over the same socket. It will also support a basic control channel with service
id 0. Due to use of single socket for command/response and events it is
possible that event(s) will be received before response to command.

	0            8       16                  24            40
	+------------+--------+------------------+-------------+
	| Service ID | Opcode | Controller Index | Data Length |
	+------------+--------+------------------+-------------+
	|                                                      |

The unique service ID is assigned by this specification for each service
supported by tester.

As general rule of thumb, the opcode for command matches the opcode for a
response. Or the opcode 0x00 for an error is returned.

Events opcodes start from 0x80.

All fields are in little-endian byte order (least significant byte first).

Controller Index can have a special value <non-controller> to indicate that
command or event is not related to any controller. Possible values:

	<controller id>		0x00 to 0xFE
	<non-controller>	0xFF

Error response is common for all services and has fixed structure:

	Opcode 0x00 - Error response

		Response parameters: Status (1 octet)

		Valid status values:	0x01 = Fail
					0x02 = Unknown Command
					0x03 = Not ready
					0x04 = Invalid Index


BTP Services
============

Each service commands and events are defined in separate text file named
btp_SERVICE_NAME.txt. The currently defined services are listed below. Core Service
is mandatory to be supported by IUT.
