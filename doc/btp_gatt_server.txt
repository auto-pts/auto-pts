GATT Server Service (ID 7)

Once service is registered it is expected that the database contains all
services and characteristics required by tests supported by IUT.

Commands and responses:

        Opcode 0x01 - Read Supported Commands command/response

                Controller Index:       <non-controller>
                Command parameters:     <none>
                Response parameters:    <supported commands> (variable)

                Each bit in response is a flag indicating if command with
                opcode matching bit number is supported. Bit set to 1 means
                that command is supported. Bit 0 is reserved and shall always
                be set to 0. If specific bit is not present in response (less
                than required bytes received) it shall be assumed that command
                is not supported.

                In case of an error, the error response will be returned.

        Opcode 0x02 - Initialize GATT database

                Controller Index:       <non-controller>
                Command parameters:     Database_ID (1 octet)
                                        Flags (4 octets)
                Response parameters:    <none>

                This command is used to initialize GATT server with specified
                database. Database_ID is used to identify which database shall
                be initialized. Flags are used for behaviour tuning (currently
                none are defined and shall be set to all zero). Details of
                initialized database are IUT specific and shall allow for
                testing IUT's supported features.

                In case of an error, the error response will be returned.

        Opcode 0x03 - Get Attributes

                Controller Index:       <non-controller>
                Command parameters:     Start Handle (2 octets)
                                        End Handle (2 octets)
                                        Type_Length (1 octet)
                                        Type (2 or 16 octets)
                Response parameters:    Attributes_Count (1 octet)
                                        [array] Attribute (variable)

                Object Attribute is defined as:
                                        Handle (2 octets)
                                        Permission (1 octet)
                                        Type_Length (1 octet)
                                        Type (2 or 16 octets)

                Valid Type_Length parameter values:
                        0x02 = UUID16
                        0x10 = UUID128

                This procedure is used to query GATT Server for attributes based
                on given search pattern. Attributes can be searched using
                Attribute Handle range and Attribute Type.

                In case of an error, the error response will be returned.

        Opcode 0x04 - Get Attribute Value

                Controller Index:       <controller id>
                Command parameters:     Address_Type (1 octet)
                                        Address (6 octets)
                                        Handle (2 octets)
                Response parameters:    Value_Length (2 octet)
                                        Value (variable)

                This procedure is used to query GATT Server for attribute value.

                In case of an error, the error response will be returned.

        Opcode 0x05 - Set Characteristic/Descriptor Value

                Controller Index:       <controller id>
                Command parameters:     Address_Type (1 octet)
                                        Address (6 octets)
                                        Handle (2 octets)
                                        Value_Length (2 octet)
                                        Value (variable)
                Response parameters:    <none>

                This command is used to set the value of characteristic
                or descriptor.

                In case of an error, the error response will be returned.

        Opcode 0x06 - Change Database

                Controller Index:       <controller id>
                Command parameters:     <none>
                Response parameters:    <none>

                This procedure is used to change content of database that will
                result in peer doing database re-discovery. Details of how
                database is changed is IUT specific.

                In case of an error, the error response will be returned.

Events:

        Opcode 0x81 - Attribute Value Changed

                Controller Index:       <controller id>
                Event parameters:       Address_Type (1 octet)
                                        Address (6 octets)
                                        Handle (2 octets)
                                        Data_Length (2 octet)
                                        Data (variable)

                This event command is used to indicate attribute
                (characteristic or descriptor) value changed.
                Event is triggered when ATT Write operation to Tester GATT
                Server has been performed successfully.
