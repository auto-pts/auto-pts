OTS Service (ID 29)
=====================

Commands and responses:

        Opcode 0x00 - Error response

        Opcode 0x01 - Read Supported Commands command/response

                Controller Index:       <non-controller>
                Command parameters:     <none>
                Response parameters:    <supported commands> (variable)

                Each bit in response is a flag indicating if command with
                opcode matching bit number is supported. Bit set to 1 means
                that command is supported. Bit 0 is reserved and shall always
                be set to 0. If specific bit is not present in response (less
                than required bytes received) it shall be assumed that command
                is not supported.

                In case of an error, the error response will be returned.

        Opcode 0x02 - Register Object command/response

                Controller Index:       <controller id>
                Command parameters:     Flags (1 octet)
                                        Properties (4 octets)
                                        Allocation_Size 4 octets)
                                        Current_Size (4 octets)
                                        Name_Length (1 octet)
                                        Name (variable)
                Response parameters:    Object_ID (4 octets)

                This command is used to register new Object in OTS server with
                specified parameters. Properties are OTS Object properties as per
                specification. Allocation and current sizes defines Object sizes
                as per specification.

                Possible values for the Flags parameter are a bit-wise or of
                the following bits:
                        0 = Skip Unsupported Properties

                In case of an error, the error response will be returned.
