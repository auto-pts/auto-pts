CSIS Service (ID 17)
===================

Commands and responses:

        Opcode 0x00 - Error response

        Opcode 0x01 - Read Supported Commands command/response

                Controller Index:       <non-controller>
                Command parameters:     <none>
                Response parameters:    <supported commands> (variable)

                Each bit in response is a flag indicating if command with
                opcode matching bit number is supported. Bit set to 1 means
                that command is supported. Bit 0 is reserved and shall always
                be set to 0. If specific bit is not present in response (less
                than required bytes received) it shall be assumed that command
                is not supported.

                In case of an error, the error response will be returned.

        Opcode 0x02: CSIS Set Member Lock

                Controller Index:       <controller id>
                Command parameters:     Address_Type (1 octet)
                                        Address (6 octets)
                                        Lock (1 octet)
                                        Force (1 octet)
                Response parameters:    <None>

                Address Type is a byte; Address type of the PTS address.
                Address is a 6 octet address; Address of the PTS.
                Lock is a boolean; True to set the Lock; False to release the Lock.
                Force is a boolean; True to force the Lock operation; False otherwise.
                Force is only relevant when releasing the member Lock.
                In this case it will force release the lock, regardless of who took the lock.

                This command is used to set the member Lock.

                In case of an error, the error response will be returned.

        Opcode 0x03: CSIS Get Member RSI

                Controller Index:       <controller id>
                Command parameters:     Address_Type (1 octet)
                                        Address (6 octets)
                Response parameters:    RSI (6 octets)

                Address Type is a byte; Address type of the PTS address.
                Address is a 6 octet address; Address of the PTS.

                RSI is a 6 octet Resolvable Set Identifier.

                This command is used to generate and return a new RSI (Resolvable Set Identifier).

                In case of an error, the error response will be returned.

        Opcode 0x04 - CSIS Set SIRK Type

                Controller Index:       <controller id>
                Command parameters:     SIRK Type (1 octet)
                Response parameters:    <none>

                This command is used to set SIRK type.
                        0 - Plain text SIRK
                        1 - Encrypted SIRK
                        2 - OOB procedure SIRK only

        Opcode 0x05 - CSIS Set SIRK

                Controller Index:       <controller id>
                Command parameters:     SIRK (16 octets)
                Response parameters:    <none>

                This command is used to set the SIRK.

                In case of an error, the error response will be returned.

        Opcode 0x06 - CSIS Set Set Size

                Controller Index:       <controller id>
                Command parameters:     Size (1 octet)
                                        Rank (1 octet)
                Response parameters:    <none>

                This command is used to set the size of the coordinated set as well
                as the rank of the device within that set.

                In case of an error, the error response will be returned.
