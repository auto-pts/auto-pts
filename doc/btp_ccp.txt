CCP Service (ID 19)
===================

Commands and responses:

	Opcode 0x00 - Error response

	Opcode 0x01 - Read Supported Commands command/response

		Controller Index:	<non-controller>
		Command parameters:	<none>
		Response parameters:	<supported commands> (variable)

		Each bit in response is a flag indicating if command with
		opcode matching bit number is supported. Bit set to 1 means
		that command is supported. Bit 0 is reserved and shall always
		be set to 0. If specific bit is not present in response (less
		than required bytes received) it shall be assumed that command
		is not supported.

		In case of an error, the error response will be returned.

		Address Type is a byte; Address type of the PTS address.
		Address is a 6 octet address; Address of the PTS.
		This command is used to discover the GTBS and any TBS instances and all 
		their characteristics. It will also enable notifications/indications for all 
		characteristics that support it.

		Note: A Discovery Complete Event will be issued when discovery has completed.

		In case of an error, the error response will be returned.

		Address is a 6 octet address; Address of the PTS.
		Index is a byte; It holds the index of the TBS to address.
		Note: To address the GTBS use an index value of BT_TBS_GTBS_INDEX(0xff).
		To address an ordinary TBS use an index value in the range [0, TBS_COUNT[, 
		where TBS_COUNT is the number of TBS instances returned by the Discovery 
		Complete Event.

		Call Identifier is a byte; A unique Call Identifier assigned by the Server.

		This command is used to Accept a Call.

		In case of an error, the error response will be returned.

					Address (6 octets)
					Index (1 octet)
					Call Identifier (1 octet)
		Response parameters:	<None>

		Address Type is a byte; Address type of the PTS address.
		Address is a 6 octet address; Address of the PTS.
		Index is a byte; It holds the index of the TBS to address.
		Note: To address the GTBS use an index value of BT_TBS_GTBS_INDEX(0xff).
		To address an ordinary TBS use an index value in the range [0, TBS_COUNT[, 
		where TBS_COUNT is the number of TBS instances returned by the Discovery 
		Complete Event.

		Call Identifier is a byte; A unique Call Identifier assigned by the Server.

		This command is used to add Terminate a Call.

		In case of an error, the error response will be returned.

	Opcode 0x05: CCP Originate Call

		Controller Index:	<controller id>
		Command parameters:	Address_Type (1 octet)
					Address (6 octets)
					Index (1 octet)
					Call URI Length (1 octet)
					Call URI (N octets)
		Response parameters:	<None>

		Address Type is a byte; Address type of the PTS address.
		Address is a 6 octet address; Address of the PTS.
		Index is a byte; It holds the index of the TBS to address.
		Note: To address the GTBS use an index value of BT_TBS_GTBS_INDEX(0xff).
		To address an ordinary TBS use an index value in the range [0, TBS_COUNT[, 
		where TBS_COUNT is the number of TBS instances returned by the Discovery 
		Complete Event.

		Call URI Length is a byte; Length in bytes of the Call URI.

		Call URI is a zero-terminated UTF-8 string; Call URI expressed as <URI scheme>:
		<Caller ID>, where <URI Scheme> must be one of the supported URI Schemes.

		This command is used to Originate a Call.

		In case of an error, the error response will be returned.

	Opcode 0x06: CCP Read Call States

		Controller Index:	<controller id>
		Command parameters:	Address_Type (1 octet)
					Address (6 octets)
					Index (1 octet)
		Response parameters:	<None>

		Address Type is a byte; Address type of the PTS address.
		Address is a 6 octet address; Address of the PTS.
		Index is a byte; It holds the index of the TBS to address.
		Note: To address the GTBS use an index value of BT_TBS_GTBS_INDEX(0xff).
		To address an ordinary TBS use an index value in the range [0, TBS_COUNT[, 
		where TBS_COUNT is the number of TBS instances returned by the Discovery 
		Complete Event.

		This command is used to read the current Call states.

		Note: A Read Call States Event will be issued when the Call States have 
		been read.

		In case of an error, the error response will be returned.

Events:
	Opcode 0x80 - Discover Completed event

		Controller Index:	<controller id>
		Event parameters:	Status (4 octets)
					TBS Count (1 octet)
					GTBS Found (1 octet)

		Status is an integer; A Status of 0 indicates success, any other value indicates an error.
		TBS Count is byte; Returning the number of TBS instances found.
		GTBS Found is a boolean; True if an instance of GTBS was found; False otherwise.

        	This event indicates that the IUT finished discovery of GTBS and TBS instances,
        	their characteristics and optionally subscribing to their notifications/indications.

	Opcode 0x81 - Read Call States event

		Controller Index:	<controller id>
		Event parameters:	Status (4 octets)
					Index (1 octet)
					Call Count (1 octet)
					<repeated for each call>
						Call Index (1 octet)
						State (1 octet)
						Flags (1 octet)

		Status is an integer; A Status of 0 indicates success, any other value indicates an error.

		Index is a byte; It holds the index of the TBS to address.
		Note: To address the GTBS use an index value of BT_TBS_GTBS_INDEX(0xff).
		To address an ordinary TBS use an index value in the range [0, TBS_COUNT[, 
		where TBS_COUNT is the number of TBS instances returned by the Discovery 
		Complete Event.

		Call Count is byte; It holds the number of active calls.

		Call Index is a byte; It holds the Server assigned Call Identifier.

		State is a byte; It holds the call state (see below).

		Flags is a byte: It holds additional information about the call (see below)

		State is an enum with the following values:
			0 - Incoming
			1 - Dialling
			2 - Alerting
			3 - Active
			4 - Locally Held
			5 - Remotely Held
			6 - Locally and Remotely Held

		Flags is bitfield with the following values:
			Bit 0 - Incoming/Outgoing
			Bit 1 - Not Withheld/Withheld
			Bit 2 - Provided by Network/Withheld by Network
			
        	This event indicates that the IUT finished reading the call states.
		If there are any active calls, Call Count > 0, Call State (3 octets) will 
		be returned for each active call.
