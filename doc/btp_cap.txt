Commands and responses:

	Opcode 0x00 - Error response

	Opcode 0x01 - Read Supported Commands command/response

		Controller Index:	<non-controller>
		Command parameters:	<none>
		Response parameters:	<supported commands> (variable)

		Each bit in response is a flag indicating if command with
		opcode matching bit number is supported. Bit set to 1 means
		that command is supported. Bit 0 is reserved and shall always
		be set to 0. If specific bit is not present in response (less
		than required bytes received) it shall be assumed that command
		is not supported.

		In case of an error, the error response will be returned.

	Opcode 0x02 - Discover and Subscribe

		This command is used to discover all remote PACS, ASCS and BASS
		characteristics. In case of an error, the error status response
		will be returned. In case of a success, the IUT continues processing
		the command asynchronously. During discovery, the IUT may send events:
					Discover and Subscribe Completed event
