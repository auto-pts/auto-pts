Commands and responses:

        Opcode 0x00 - Error response

        Opcode 0x01 - Read Supported Commands command/response

                Controller Index:       <non-controller>
                Command parameters:     <none>
                Response parameters:    <supported commands> (variable)

                Each bit in response is a flag indicating if command with
                opcode matching bit number is supported. Bit set to 1 means
                that command is supported. Bit 0 is reserved and shall always
                be set to 0. If specific bit is not present in response (less
                than required bytes received) it shall be assumed that command
                is not supported.

                In case of an error, the error response will be returned.

        Opcode 0x02 - Discover and Subscribe

                Controller Index:       <controller id>
                Command parameters:     Address_Type (1 octet)

                Response parameters:    <none>

                This command is used to discover all remote PACS, ASCS and BASS
                characteristics. In case of an error, the error status response
                will be returned. In case of a success, the IUT continues processing
                the command asynchronously. During discovery, the IUT may send events:
                                        Discover and Subscribe Completed event
                                        Codec Capabilities Found event

                This command is used to configure an ASE locally before executing
                the Unicast Audio Start procedure. Can be called once per ASE,
                while twice per CIS, as the Sink/Source ASE might share single CIS.

                stream instance.

                This command is used to execute the Unicast Audio Update procedure.
                In case of an error, the error status response will be returned.
